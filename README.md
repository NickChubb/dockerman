# DockerMan(ager) (Inactive ðŸš«)

A simple server-side docker controller made with React.  Useful as a web backend for serving up containers.

**Tech Stack: React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Docker.js, SQLite**

I am currently no longer working on this project, as I have moved to using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) for hosting my personal portfolio website and other projects.
